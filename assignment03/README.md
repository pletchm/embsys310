# EMBSYS 310 - AU20 Assignment 03
This is the directory containing my work for Assignment 03.

TODO: ![1_locals_view](1_locals_view.PNG)

## Goal
1. Become familiar with C programming language's pre-processor, volatile directive,    and how GPIOs work.
2. Explore using the STM32MXCube too to generate code for the evaluation board.

## Problems:
1. Follow the same steps as we did in the class to blink LED1 (PA5) at a visible
   rate.
2. Use XOR bit-wise operator to toggle the LED. See the program for proplems _1_ and _2_ here:
   [BlinkingLED1/main.c](https://github.com/pletchm/embsys310/blob/main/assignment03/BlinkingLED1/main.c).
3. Morse Code is considered a sequence of binaries.
