# Why use Two's Complement to represent negative numbers?
2's complement is used to represent negative numbers to make binary number addition and
subtraction simpler. Basically, we only need to implement binary addition, but operands
are converted to their correponding 2's complement appropriately such that the operation
can be converted into an addition operation. e.g., 9 - 5 would be converted to 9 + (-5).
